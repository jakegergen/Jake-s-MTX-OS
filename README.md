# Jake-s-MTX-OS

My professor K.C Wang has designed the MTX operating system and wrote "Design and Implementation of the MTX Operating System" detailing his work. Throughout the semester showed us how to develop our own version of the MTX OS. Details on running and assembling the project can be found at https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/
